# ImageSegmentation-SartorLab
## Technologies Used
**Python**: Python is the primary programming language used in this project for its versatility, extensive libraries, and ease of use.

**Ultralytics YOLOv8**: YOLOv8, developed by Ultralytics, is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection and image segmentation tasks. It provides efficient and accurate results, making it suitable for our project in detecting the Lemna gibba in the images.

**Roboflow**: Roboflow is utilized for data preprocessing tasks such as data augmentation, normalization, and annotation management. We used this to streamlines the data preparation process by annotating hundreds of images of the Lemna gibba, ensuring high-quality input data for training the YOLOv8 model.

**R**: R is used for testing and analyzing the segmentation results obtained from the YOLOv8 model. Its statistical and visualization capabilities are leveraged to evaluate the performance of the segmentation algorithm and gain insights from the results.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ultralytics.

```bash
pip install ultralytics==8.0.28
```
